🎯 Child Emotion Detection & Sentiment Analysis System

A web-based sentiment analysis system that detects a child’s facial emotions in real time and predicts the child’s mood. The system also integrates a survey module to improve accuracy by combining facial emotion recognition with user responses.

This project is designed to help parents, teachers, and caregivers better understand a child’s emotional state using technology.

📌 Project Overview

Children often find it difficult to clearly express their emotions. This system automatically analyzes facial expressions captured through a webcam and classifies the child’s mood. To increase reliability, a short survey is also included. The final result is a combined emotion analysis based on both facial data and survey input.
